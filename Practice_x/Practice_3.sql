-- Pairing customer avg payment for the month with avg payment for the month
-- We can get this query working strictly with window functions. 
-- I find it to be fairly difficult to think of how to get it working this way though:
-- SELECT distinct avg(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date), 
-- 								  customer_id) as cu_average, 
-- 								  customer_id, 
-- avg(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date)) as month_average, EXTRACT(month FROM payment_date) as month
-- FROM payment
-- --group by customer_id, month
-- ORDER BY customer_id, month asc;

-- In contrast we can get the same thing working with CTEâ€™s and 
-- I find it to be much more straightforward figuring out how the whole thing will work:
